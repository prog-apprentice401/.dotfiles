TESLA'S OPTIMUS

	The Tesla Bot, or Tesla's Optimus, is a friendly humanoid robot, and its prototype is expected to
be released this year. It is the project of the automaker, Tesla, for use in its production line. In the
future, Tesla expects to make the bot functional for doing household work, and reducing the labour burden
on people.
	The bot will have a 5 foot 8 inch tall body, equipped with 40 actuators for movement, of which 12
will be in the hands themselves. Its maximum speed will not be much - around 5mph. The head will be equipped
with a screen for displaying information, and 8 cameras. It is expected to be a somewhat general purpose robot,
doing 'dangerous, repetitive and boring' tasks, as Elon Musk said. 
	It will use technologies developed by the company for use in its self-driving cars, like the Dojo
supercomputer built for computer vision training.
	There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding this robot, and many people believe that this idea of
Elon Musk is far too ambitious to be executed and delivered in the expected time frame, since the required
technologies to execute the project don't exist yet. Regardless, in the development of this project, there
will be many leaps and technological breakthroughs, and maybe one day, we'll all have such bots helping us
around the house.
